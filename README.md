# A super simple react app template

Template to easy kickstart react learning. Includes `webpack` setup with `babel`, super simple server-side rendering and `scss` or `css` for styles.
Checkout `client` directory for sample components and write your own!

There is no `hot module replacement`, `webpack dev-middleware` and so on, just a dead-simple setup that enough to start with react.

To build/watch client-app:
```
$ npm run front-watch
```


To run server:
```
$ npm run server
```
